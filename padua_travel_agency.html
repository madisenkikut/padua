	<h1>All About the Terracotta Army</h1>
	<p> &nbsp;	The Terracotta Army is a collection of terracotta sculptures that were in
	the army of Quin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. These sculptures inclue 
	the army members who vary in height, the generals being 
	the tallest, charriots, and horses.The sculptures were buried
	with Quin Shi Huang to protect him in his afterlife in 201-209 BCE. These sculptures
	were discovered in 1974 by farmers in Lintong District, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. They found 
	them in three pits, which contained more than 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots,
	520 horses and 150 cavalry horses in total. Other non-military sculptures including officials,
	acrobats, strongmen, and musicians were found in pits nearby the army. You can see all of 
	this if you visit.
